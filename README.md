# Regression Analysis in Excel

# Overview
This dataset is for ABC Multistate bank with following columns:

- _RowNumber_, unique no.
- _CustomerId_, unique id represents the individual customer.
- _Surname_, last name of the customer
- _CreditScore_, number that measures customers risk.
- _Geography_, country the customer is based, and its categorical variable.
- _Gender_, Female or Male, its categorical variable.
- _Age_, age of the person.
- _Tenure_, for how many years the customer is with the bank.
- _Balance_, available amount for withdrawals.
- _NumOfProducts_, no of products the customer has and, its a categorical variable.
- _HasCrCard_, if customer owes credit card. 1 for yes and 0 for no.
- _IsActiveMember_, 1 for he/she is active and 0 for not active.
- _EstimatedSalary_, Salary.
- _Exited, 1 if the client has left the bank and 0 if he/she has not. Its the target

The original files were exported from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravtopre/bank-customer-churn-dataset), and are available in this repository as an [Excel](https://github.com/mrunalibharshankar/RegressionAnalysis/blob/main/Churn_Modelling1.xls) document.

Regression analysis is a statistical technique used to examine the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal is to understand how the independent variables impact the dependent variable.

For Regression Analysis to approximate how two variables in a dataset are related. In the following dataset for regression, we’ll have:
- An independent variable, which is explanatory variable. This variable can be directly controlled.
- A dependent variable, which is target variable. This variable cannot be directly controlled, and can depend on independent variable.

The general form of a regression equation is:
- Y= β0 + β1*X1 +β2X2+…+βnXn+ϵ

The general line graph, we know that our independent variable runs along the x-axis, and our dependent variable runs along the y-axis
